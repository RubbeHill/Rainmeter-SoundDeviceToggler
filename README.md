# Rainmeter-SoundDeviceToggler
A skin for Rainmeter that allows you to toggle the default sound device in Windows.
You just have to insert the name of two of your sound devices, and then you can toggle between them using a simple button.
The skin uses a small command-line utility called NirCmd to set the default sound device.
It also comes with a small setting skin, so you don't have to change any code to customize it.
